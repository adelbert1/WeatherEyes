reg_login_test is developed as a pytest for the registration and login systems. To ensure it works propeerly, make sure the chromedriver.exe file is stored in the same directory from which the reg_login_test.py file is being run. 

An additional file titled "reg_login_manualtest" is provided to run the tests manually from within an IDLE.
