# WeatherEyes

WeatherEyes is a web application that enables a user to compare historical weather data and weather forecasts from three different weather tracking organizations: 1) The National Weather Service, 2) AccuWeather, and 3) Weather.com.

Four projects were undertaken to create this application. They were:
1) Collect and provide historic weather records from each of the three organizations.
2) Collect and provide weather forecasts from each of the three organizations.
3) Create a website that will enable a user to able to view weather information--future and prior forecasts as well as prior observations--by visiting a web page.
4) Enable website customization for individual users by allowing them to create accounts, customize the information they want to see, and remembering those customizations.

The four projects were undertaken using an Agile methodology with a team of five students and completed over the course of two flights organized over 6 weeks of time.

To orient yourself, we recommend you begin by referring to the Design, Deployment1, and Deployment2 documents. From there, the "documentation" and pdoc files will provide additional contextual information and details about the code as needed.

Note: reg_login_test is developed as a pytest for the registration and login systems. To ensure it works propeerly, make sure the chromedriver.exe file is stored in the same directory from which the reg_login_test.py file is being run. 

An additional file titled "reg_login_manualtest" is provided to run the tests manually from within an IDLE.
